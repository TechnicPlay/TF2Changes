# TF2Changes
This is a list of suggestions, how Team Fortress 2 could be changed for the better. The people behind this are TF2 players themselves and members of the steam group / competetive team [Gentlemerc's Union](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gentlemercsunion). We are playing TF2 for quite a while now and still have a great time playing it.

This is still work in progress and may change often.

## Remarks
- All percentages mentioned in "weapon changes" refer to the current stock weapon in Team Fortress 2
- We aren't professionals by any means and don't guarantee that anything could be changed for the better (but one can try)
- All suggestions are from our personal point of view
